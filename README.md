### A Eaglercraft Client in Beta.

This is a client that is heavily based of Resent. I will be adding more features and a title screen that isn't theirs very soon.

## Another note: I am no longer updating the files in this repository. I do not have the time nor patience to update this repo every single update. Newest versions are in the discord

## FAQ

### Offline download?

Follow the youtube guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAZfXRdq-wQ). **PLEASE NOTE: IF THE OUTPUT SAYS "Killed" THAT MEANS YOU SELECTED TOO MANY TEXTURE PACKS. BECAUSE OF THIS, USE [GITPOD](https://gitpod.io) TO CREATE YOUR OFFLINE DOWNLOAD. ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE IF YOU HAVE A PC IS TO RUN IT LOCALLY.** We are unable to provide an offline download of every single texture pack because it crashes most computers. Instead, you should follow the guide above in order to create an offline download of your desired texture packs.

### Eaglercraft 1.8?

Resent will be ported ASAP when the source code for eaglercraft 1.8 comes out.

### Which texture pack is best?

Good fps and good quality packs: Dino 16x, Venom 16x, Violet crystal pvp 32x

Good fps pack: Bare bones 16x

Decent fps and very good quality pack: Blue 128x

(I haven't tested most of the texture packs, these are just the ones that I've used or heard others use, I'm probably missing 20 texture packs in every category above.)
